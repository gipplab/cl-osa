Fatal crash after police flag down car in Kensington

A man has died after the car he was travelling in crashed into the basement of a home in west London, ignoring police attempts to flag it down.
It had been speeding and crashed at about 03:10 BST on West Cromwell Road, Kensington. The Met Police has referred the case to the police watchdog.
Two men freed themselves from the vehicle while another two were released with the help of firefighters.
One of the men died at the scene and another is in a critical condition.
The other two men have been arrested and the Met Police's Directorate of Professional Standards has been informed as a matter of course.
All four of the men were believed to be in their 20s and the deceased man's next of kin have been told.
Police said officers lost sight of the car as it sped away along the A4 Tolgarth Road.
They then saw it had crashed into the property.
A woman who lived in the house which was hit by the car said: "You could hear them screaming.
"They cut them out but one didn't make it."
Another witness said: "There was a massive bang. He hit the traffic light and span round and round. He ended up in the basement.
"There is a massive cracking in the wall of the basement.
"The police were chasing him."
The incident has been referred to the police watchdog.
Parts of the A4 - a busy dual carriageway into and out of London - were closed for officers to carry out investigations.
It has reopened towards Heathrow but remains closed eastbound between Hammersmith flyover and Earl's Court Road.
