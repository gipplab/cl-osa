Boy George sketch outsells Gormley artwork in charity auction

A sketch by pop star Boy George has sold for more in a charity auction than an original artwork by the Angel of the North creator Antony Gormley.
The singer's A5 ink drawing titled Loving The Alien fetched £4,300 in an eBay auction for the Gloucestershire hospice charity Longfield.
A new drawing called Reflection IV, 2016 donated by Mr Gormley sold for £2,700.
Hattie Allsop from the charity said the results had been "amazing".
About 200 artworks were listed in the The Big Heart auction to raise funds for the small Minchinhampton-based charity.
Many of the pieces were donated after an appeal by Los Angeles stylist Dave Thomas who grew up in Gloucester and whose aunt was looked after by the hospice.
Mr Thomas said: "(Boy George) did that back stage at the Hollywood Bowl when he was performing with the LA Philharmonic Orchestra so it is quite a special one."
A second painting by the former Culture Club singer called Old Punks Never Die, which he donated "in memory of Aunty Sue", sold for £2,251.
Other top sellers included a doodled self-portrait by Lionel Richie which attracted 38 bids and sold for £300 and a "limited edition" drawing of a sheep by David Cameron called Ewe Matter which raised £92
Ms Alsop said the auction had raised £15,000 for the charity but an LA buyer had offered another £4,300 if Boy George would replicate his pen and ink sketch.
"He's going to agree," she said.
"His stylist will be on to him."
