Brexit vote: The breakdown

New research has cast fresh light on who decided to vote Leave in June's referendum - and provides further evidence of how they saw off the Remainers.
The National Centre for Social Research report is based on a "synthesis of evidence" from the British Social Attitudes Survey of 3,000 adults; the NCSR's own panel of almost 4,000 people, in May/June and September; and the British Election Study Panel of around 30,000 people.
The National Centre for Social Research finds that of those who told it in May that they were likely to vote Leave, 11% did not actually vote.
For those saying they were likely to vote Remain, the non-voting figure was 19%.
The Remain vote "clearly softened during the campaign", the report finds.

Among those citing the economy, it was 15%.

When questioned on their feelings about life, the people most likely to vote Leave were:
The report also notes a "slow burn of Euroscepticism" and that the referendum highlighted "a wide range of social, geographic and other differences".
It was not, it adds, a "traditional left-right battle" but one more about "identity and values", calling it a "strong sign that the so-called 'culture wars' of the US have arrived in Great Britain in earnest".
