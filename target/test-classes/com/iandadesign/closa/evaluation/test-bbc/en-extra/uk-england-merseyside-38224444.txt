Robin nests in Liverpool Cathedral Christmas tree

A robin has "delighted" a cathedral's congregation by taking up residence in its Christmas tree.
Liverpool Cathedral staff noticed the bird shortly after the tree was installed. It is believed to have got into the branches while the tree was stored outside the building.
A spokesman said the bird was "nesting or at least sleeping in the tree" and had taken a few people "by surprise".
He added that the robin had become "a welcome addition to services".
Director of communications Stuart Haynes said there may also be a second bird but that was "not certain".
Robins and their nests are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, but only pair up for the duration of the breeding season.
According to the RSPB, robins can start courtship in January but the breeding season normally begins in March.
Mr Haynes said staff "will be talking about how we manage the situation when the tree needs to be taken out".
"It may be tricky but we will want to make sure it's looked after," he said.
