Dukes of Hazzard star Tom Wopat denies groping woman

Dukes of Hazzard actor Tom Wopat has appeared in court to deny drug possession and groping a fellow cast member in a musical.
Mr Wopat, 65, was freed on $1,000 (£760) bail and told to stay away from the woman whose buttocks he allegedly grabbed.
The 65-year-old pleaded not guilty to indecent assault and battery and the drug charge.
He was arrested in a Boston suburb on Wednesday night.
According to court documents, Mr Wopat said he flirts but did "nothing that could be considered inappropriate".
The 1980s TV star also told police he buys cocaine "in large quantities and uses it over time".
Waltham, Massachusetts, police Det Sgt Tim King told the BBC: "During an inventory search of Mr Wopat and his vehicle, two bags of white powder believed to be cocaine were discovered."
Mr Wopat was due to star in 42nd Street starting on Thursday, but the theatre announced that a different actor would play the role.
Hours before he was to tread the boards, Mr Wopat's official Twitter feed posted an advert for the performance.
It is due to run from 3-13 August at the Reagle Music Theater in Waltham.
"Don't miss your chance to see it!" read the post, before it was deleted.
Mr Wopat's movie credits in recent years include the Oscar-winning Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained (2012).
But he is still best known for his role as lovable rogue Luke Duke in The Dukes of Hazzard, which aired from 1979-1985.
