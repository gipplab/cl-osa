General election 2017 results night: When will we know who's won?

Here's a full guide to UK general election night on the BBC - including the key results to watch out for as the night unfolds.
Results have started coming in at quite a pace, but there are many more still to come. Most counts will be completed by 06:00 BST.
Some won't be in until lunchtime on Friday, with Berwick-upon-Tweed, Blyth Valley and Wansbeck usually last to declare.
However, the overall outcome of the election should become clear much earlier than that.
To get an idea of where the main parties are likely to make gains or where the result is too close to call, have a look at our seat-by-seat forecast.

Here is a full list of estimated declaration times from the Press Association
All timings are approximate
3am Results are coming in thick and fast - at the rate of about five per minute. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron's result in Westmorland and Lonsdale, where he is facing a strong Tory challenge, could be interesting.
4am One of politics' big hitters - Alex Salmond, in Gordon - is expected to be re-elected around now. Results in key Lib Dem targets Cheltenham and Bath are also expected. The Conservatives are targeting three seats in Scotland - the first to declare is likely to be Dumfries and Galloway around now. If they take this seat from the SNP, Theresa May could be looking at a big majority overall. Aberdeenshire West and Kincardine and top target Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk are set to declare a little later.
4.30am Theresa May faces little threat in Maidenhead, but we could find out what she makes of the national results when she speaks at her count.
5am UKIP leader Paul Nuttall will find out whether he has unseated his Conservative opponent, who was a Remainer, in Boston and Skegness.
6am Brighton Pavilion should return Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas as its MP but the party is hoping to gain an extra seat in Bristol West. As dawn breaks we should have both results.
