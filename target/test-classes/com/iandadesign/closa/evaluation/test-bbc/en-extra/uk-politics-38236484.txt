Election 2017: English mayoral candidates

On 4 May 2017 six regions of England held elections for newly created combined authority mayors.
Results are expected on Friday and will be available here
The new mayors' remits will cover multiple local authorities, in mostly urban areas.
Their main responsibility will be to decide their region's economic strategy, and many will have powers covering other areas such as transport and housing. However, their exact powers will vary according to the terms of the agreements each region has made with the government.
In addition, Doncaster and North Tyneside councils are holding elections for directly-elected mayors. The mayors act as executive leaders of these local authorities.
