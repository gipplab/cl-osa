While support for the Lib Dems in England dropped slightly, dwindled for the Greens, and fell off a cliff for UKIP, the combined vote share for the Conservatives and Labour is at its highest for decades.
"I believe it's only a temporary return to two-party politics," UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said as he announced his resignation.
The Conservatives lost six seats in the capital, losing Battersea, Croydon Central, Enfield Southgate and Kensington to Labour, who saw its majorities increase in a number of constituencies.
The Liberal Democrats also made gains in London as former government ministers Sir Vince Cable and Sir Ed Davey both won back the seats they had lost in 2015 to the Conservatives.
The Liberal Democrats lost both of the seats they previously held in the Yorkshire and the Humber region.
The most high-profile scalp came in Sheffield Hallam, where the party's former leader and former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg lost the seat he had held since 2005 to Labour.
The Conservatives suffered losses in the South East, losing six seats in the region, four to Labour and two to the Liberal Democrats.
Labour defeated the Conservatives to gain Canterbury, winning the constituency for the first time since it was formed in 1918.
Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas held Brighton Pavilion, increasing her vote share in the seat to above 50%.
When a party gets less than 5% of the vote in a constituency, it loses the £500 deposit each candidate needs to put down to stand.
And in terms of lost deposits, some of the smaller parties in Westminster had disastrous nights.
While the Lib Dems increased its number of MPs, it lost its deposit in 375 seats. UKIP lost 337 deposits. But the party with the most lost deposits was the Greens, they only saved their deposit in 11 of the 466 constituencies they contested.
Labour's traditional strongholds stand out on the map below. With many seats in the north of England, south Wales and London showing Labour taking more than 50% of the vote.
