The Conservatives have made gains while Labour, UKIP, the Lib Dems and the SNP have all lost ground.
Labour has lost more than 380 council seats, UKIP has suffered heavy losses and the Lib Dems have not made the gains they had hoped for.
The Conservatives appear to have been the main beneficiaries of a decline in support for UKIP.
The party is now in charge of 11 more councils having taken Derbyshire from Labour as well as Warwickshire, Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire, the Isle of Wight and Monmouthshire - all of which were previously under no overall control.
They also increased their total number of councillors in Scotland by more than 160.

The party has lost control of seven councils, including Glasgow, as well as Bridgend and Blaenau Gwent. It also lost the metro mayor contests in the West Midlands and Tees Valley, a traditional Labour heartland, to the Conservatives - but former cabinet minister Andy Burnham scored a big win in Greater Manchester.
