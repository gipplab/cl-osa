Qatar crisis: Restrictions to continue, Saudi Arabia says

Restrictions on Qatar will continue after it rejected the ultimatum made by its Middle East neighbours, Saudi Arabia has said.

Mr Thani said this could be sustained "indefinitely".
The window for dialogue to resolve this dispute is not yet completely shut but it is fast heading that way.
Qatar has refused to comply with the 13 demands made by the Saudi-led quartet, so now the ball is in their court. They have three possible courses of action:
