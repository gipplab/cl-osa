<p> CHARLOTTE (AP) -- [[Wachovia|First Union]] Corp. says it has fired seven employees within the last week for sending
    [[Pornography|pornographic|0.8]] and other inappropriate [[E-mail|e-mail|0.6]]. </p>
<p></p>
<p> First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank, confirmed the firings Friday, but company spokeswoman Sandy Deem would

    intimidating, offensive or [[Hostile environment sexual harassment|hostile environment|0.2]],'' Deem said. </p>
<p></p>
<p> [[The Charlotte Observer]] reported Friday that employees at the University Research Park office circulated e-mail

<p> One employee fired within the past week from the bank's [[Home equity|home-equity|0.4]] division was called into an
    office, shown a stack of e-mail and fired on the spot, an employee told the newspaper. </p>
<p></p>
<p> First Union, a [[Fortune 500|Fortune 100]] corporation, joins a number of companies taking swift and severe action
    for violations of company e-mail policy. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Companies are seeking to protect themselves from [[Claim (legal)|legal claims|0.2]] that their work environment is
    hostile. An increasing number of lawsuits alleging [[sexual harassment]] have based claims in part on e-mails taken
    from company computer systems. </p></body>
