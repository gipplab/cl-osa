<body><h1 id="header">Iranian POW negotiator holds talks with Iraqi ministers</h1>
<p> The head of [[Iran]]'s [[prisoner of war]] commission met with two [[Council of Ministers of Iraq|Iraqi Cabinet
    ministers|0.2]] Saturday in a bid to glean information about thousands of Iranian POWs allegedly in Iraq, the
    official [[National Iraqi News Agency|Iraqi News Agency|0.2]] reported. </p>
<p> Iraqi Foreign Minister [[Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf|Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf]] told Abdullah al-Najafi that the two
    states needed to ``speed up the closure of what remains from the POW and [[Missing in action|Missing-In-Action|0.2]]
    file,'' INA said. </p>
<p> The issue of POWs and missing persons remains a stumbling block to normalizing relations between the two
    neighbors. </p>
<p> Iraq has long maintained that it has released all Iranian prisoners captured in the 1980-88 [[Iran-Iraq War]]. The
    countries accuse each other of hiding POWs and preventing visits by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]
    to prisoner camps. </p>
<p> The ICRC representative in [[Baghdad]], Manuel Bessler, told The [[Associated Press]] that his organization has had
    difficulty visiting POWs on both sides on a regular basis. </p>
<p> In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law
    detainees in the largest exchange since 1990. </p>
<p> More than 1 million people were killed or wounded in the Iran-Iraq War. </p></body>
