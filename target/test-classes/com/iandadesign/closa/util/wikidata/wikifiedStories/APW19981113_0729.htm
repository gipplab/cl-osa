<p> The new [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Airport|airport|0.2]], a powerful symbol of fledgling
    [[Independence|independence|0.2]], is ready to open, the head of the Palestinian [[Civil aviation|Civil
    Aviation|0.2]] Authority said Friday after an operations drill with [[Israel|Israeli]] officials. </p>
<p> [[Yasser Arafat International Airport]] in the southern [[Gaza Strip]] was to have opened last week as part of the
    [[Peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement|0.2]]. However, Israel fell
    behind schedule when it held up [[Cabinet of Israel|Cabinet|0.2]] [[Ratification|ratification|0.2]] of the accord by
    two weeks. </p>
<p> Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] has said the airport would start operating next week, but has not set a
    date. </p>
<p> On Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian officials staged a four-hour drill, said Fayez Zeidan, head of the Palestinian
    [[Civil Aviation Authority|Civil Aviation Authority|0.2]]. </p>
<p> About 100 Palestinian airport employees and 50 [[Israelis]] who will share security duties played the roles of
    passengers and airport personnel. For lack of a plane, the ``passengers'' arrived by bus. </p>
<p> Zeidan said the exercise covered arrival and departure procedures, including [[Passport|passport|0.4]] checks as
    well as [[Customs|customs|0.4]] and luggage inspection. </p>
<p> He said the airport was ready for operation. ``We just need to hear from the Israelis,'' Zeidan said. </p></body>
