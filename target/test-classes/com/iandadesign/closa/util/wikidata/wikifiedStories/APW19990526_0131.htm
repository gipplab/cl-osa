<p> [[Anchorage, Alaska|ANCHORAGE|1.0]], [[Alaska]] (AP) -- A man on a day hike in a rural area was killed when a bear
    bit his head, [[Alaska State Troopers|Alaska State Troopers|0.6]] said Wednesday. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Kenneth Cates, 53, was found Wednesday morning on a horse trail in a heavily wooded area of the [[Kenai National
    Wildlife Refuge]] near his hometown of [[Soldotna, Alaska|Soldotna]]. </p>
<p></p>
<p> The attack happened about six miles off a busy road. The area is about 60 miles southwest of Anchorage. </p>
<p></p>
<p> The fatal mauling is thought to have happened Tuesday. </p>
<p></p>
<p> His only visible wound was a single bite to the head, said Bruce Bartley, a spokesman for the state Division of
    Wildlife Conservation. </p>
<p></p>
<p> State and federal wildlife officials were looking for the bear involved in the attack. If the bear is judged to pose
    a continuing threat to humans it may be killed. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Troopers said Cates' .280-caliber [[Rifle|rifle|0.4]] and two spent shell casings were found near the body, along
    with traces of blood that suggest that Cates may have wounded the animal. </p>
<p></p>
<p> ``We don't know if one was a warning shot and one real, or if there were two real shots,'' Bartley said. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Cates' death is the first fatal bear mauling in Alaska since Feb. 8, 1998, when [[List of fatal bear attacks in
    North America by decade|Audelio Luis Cortes|0.4]], 40, was killed while working on a [[Seismology|seismic|0.2]] crew
    in the [[Swanson River]] [[Oil field|oil field|0.2]] near [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai|0.8]]. Cortes also died from a
    single head bite. </p></body>
