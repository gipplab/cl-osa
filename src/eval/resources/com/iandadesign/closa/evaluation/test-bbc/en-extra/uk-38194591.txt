Prince Harry visits Guyana rainforest community on Caribbean tour

Prince Harry has visited the heartland of Guyana and explored its rainforest on day 14 of his Caribbean tour.
The prince was welcomed to the village of Surama in the Iwokrama rainforest with a feathered headdress, before he watched a cultural dance around a pole.
He met rangers to learn about the steps being taken to protect the rainforest and the benefits of eco-tourism.
Prince Harry later visited a school and the Kaieteur Falls - one of the world's largest freefall waterfalls.
On the penultimate day of his Caribbean tour, the prince took a flight to the Iwokrama International Centre which has a close link to the Prince of Wales, who has been its patron since 2000.
He then visited Fairview village to pay his respects to its elders, as well as going to the local school.
The prince was also taken to an open-air community hall, where he was given presents including a painting of traditional homes.
He gave a speech which praised the people of the remote community, saying: "My father told me what an amazing time he had here, when he was far younger and had far more hair.
"The positive thing you are doing here, it's incredible, your leadership is so important to ensure the protection of this place."
The final stop of the day was the Kaieteur Falls, which has a drop of 250 metres - five times as high as Niagara Falls.
Earlier in the week, the prince met Barbados's biggest star, Rihanna, when the pair sat side by side at a celebratory concert. They also both took part in a HIV test to highlight World Aids Day in Bridgetown.
Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America.
Between 1780 and 1813, Guyana changed hands between the Dutch, French and British.
Guyana was home to the 1978 Jonestown massacre - a mass suicide by more than 900 members of the People's Temple religious sect led by Jim Jones.
