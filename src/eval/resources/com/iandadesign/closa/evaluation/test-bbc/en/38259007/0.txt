Sir Mick Jagger becomes dad for the eighth time aged 73

Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger has become a father again at age of 73, his publicist has confirmed.
The singer already has seven children whose ages range from 17 to 45 and he became a great-grandfather in 2014.
His 29-year-old girlfriend, American ballerina Melanie Hamrick, gave birth to a boy in New York on Thursday, the singer's publicist Bernard Doherty said.
A statement said Hamrick and Sir Mick were "both delighted" at the birth.
It added: "Mick was at the hospital for the arrival.
"Mother and baby are doing well and we request that the media respect their privacy at this time."
Sir Mick began dating Hamrick after the suicide of L'Wren Scott in 2014, his partner of 13 years.
The music star had his other children with Marsha Hunt, Bianca Jagger, Jerry Hall and Luciana Gimenez Morad.
He has five grandchildren and became a great-grandfather in May 2014 when his granddaughter Assisi, daughter of Jade Jagger, gave birth to a baby girl.
The Rolling Stones recently released a new blues album called Blue &amp; Lonesome.
