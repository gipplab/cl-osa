<body><h1 id="header">Syria opposes any attempt to overthrow Saddam Hussein</h1>
<p> [[Syria]] opposes attempts by the [[United States|United States|0.8]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain|0.6]] to
    overthrow [[Iraq|Iraqi]] leader [[Saddam Hussein]], Syrian Vice-President [[Abdul Halim Khaddam|Abdul-Halim
    Khaddam]] said Thursday. </p>
<p> Such moves would ``serve [[Israel]]'s design to disintegrate the [[Arab|Arab|0.4]] and [[Islam|Islamic|0.4]]
    world,'' Khaddam said after receiving his Iranian counterpart, [[Hassan Habibi]], at [[Damascus International
    Airport|Damascus airport]]. </p>
<p> The United States has granted dlrs 97 million to Iraqi opposition groups. British and American officials hosted
    meetings in [[London|London|0.2]] last month of 16 Iraqi dissident groups in a bid to promote cooperation among
    them. </p>
<p> ``This is a very dangerous issue ... No state in the world has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of any
    other country,'' Khaddam said. </p>
<p> Habibi said the Iraqi and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] questions were of great concern to Iran and Syria:
    ``There should be coordination between the two countries over these issues.'' </p>
<p> The official Iranian news agency, IRMA, said the Iraqi and Palestinian issues would be the focus of talks between
    Habibi and Khaddam at the meeting of the Syrian-Iranian Supreme Committee. The committee meets biannually to promote
    cooperation in foreign affairs, trade and technology. </p>
<p> Habibi, who is accompanied by [[Kamal Kharazi|Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi|0.8]], is expected to meet
    Syrian President [[Hafez al-Assad|Hafez Assad]] during his three-day visit. </p>
<p> Syria is Iran's closest Arab ally and supported the Persian state during the 1980-88 [[Iran-Iraq war]].
