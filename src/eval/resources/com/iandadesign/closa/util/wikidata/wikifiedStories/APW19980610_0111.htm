<p> A [[Russians|Russian|0.2]] businessman was killed on his way to work Wednesday by an unidentified gunman in what
    appeared to be an [[Organized crime|organized crime|0.6]] killing, according to news reports. </p>
<p> Yuri Zinin, the head of [[Gazprom Neft|Sibneft]] Company was shot in the back as he walked out of his apartment
    building in the town of Leninsk-Kuzntesky in the [[Kemerovo]] region of central [[Siberia]], Russian news agencies
    quoted local police as saying. </p>
<p> Zinin's company has the same name as one of [[Russia]]'s largest oil producers, Sibneft, controlled by controversial
    business [[Business magnate|mogul|0.2]] [[Boris Berezovsky]]. But the two companies are separate. </p>
<p> Zinin's Sibneft was locally-based and mostly involved in selling [[Oil|oil products|0.2]] and [[Coal|coal|0.4]].
    Kemerovo is one of Russia's main [[Coal mining|coal-mining|0.2]] regions. </p>
<p> Police launched a search for the killer who fled. Officials wouldn't comment on possible motives for the
    murder. </p>
<p> There are hundreds of [[Contract killing|contract murder|0.6]]s in Russia every year as [[Mobsters|mobsters|0.2]]
    fight for control of profitable businesses. Only a small number of such killings are ever solved. </p>
<p> The small town of [[Leninsk-Kuznetsky]] became known nationwide last year, when the city [[Mayor|mayor|0.2]] was
    arrested on [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax fraud|0.4]] and [[Embezzlement|embezzlement|0.4]] charges. Mayor
    [[Gennady Konyakhin|Gennady Konyakhin|1.0]], also accused of being linked to the [[Russian Mafia|mob|0.2]], is in
    custody awaiting [[Trial (law)|trial|0.2]]. </p>
