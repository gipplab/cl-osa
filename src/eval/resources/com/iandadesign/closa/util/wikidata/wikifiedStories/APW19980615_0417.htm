<body><h1 id="header">Actress Brooke Shields accepts [[Defamation|libel|1.0]] [[Damages|damages|0.4]], apology over
    false</h1>
<p> Actress [[Brooke Shields]] on Monday accepted ``very substantial'' libel damages and a public apology over a
    newspaper article alleging that she was questioned by police for two hours in connection with [[Drug|drug|0.2]]
    offenses as she left the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. </p>
<p> [[Daily Mail|The Mail on Sunday]] reported May 24 in an ``exclusive'' that began on the front page and continued on
    page three that Miss Shields' luggage was searched and her flight at the [[Côte d'Azur International Airport|Nice
    Airport]] delayed while [[French National Police|French police|0.2]] quizzed her. </p>
<p> After the actress filed suit against [[Associated Newspapers Ltd]]., the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, the
    paper's editor and two Mail journalists, the Mail on Sunday published a front-page apology and
    [[Retraction|retraction|0.6]] on May 31. </p>
<p> The retraction said the story was totally false and conceded Miss Shields had not even been stopped at the
    airport. </p>
<p> ``The defendants recognize that Miss Shields is a staunch and committed anti-drug campaigner and that she has spent
    considerable amounts of time supporting [[Substance abuse|substance abuse|0.4]] programs and raising much needed
    money for anti-drug abuse programs,'' said Claire Shields, the defendants' attorney. </p>
<p> The newspaper's front-page article ``must therefore have been especially hurtful to her and to her family,'' the
    attorney said. </p>
<p> The Sunday paper's editor, Jonathan Holborow, has written the actress, who was not present in court Monday, a
    personal letter of apology. </p>
<p> The amount of the damages was not disclosed. </p>
