<body><h1 id="header">Norwegian company moves ahead with clean power plant</h1>
<p> The [[Norsk Hydro|Norsk Hydro ASA]] concern announced plans Friday to build a [[hydrogen]]-burning [[Power
    station|power plant]] that it says will produce [[electricity]] with virtually no climate-damaging [[Air
    pollution|emissions|0.2]]. </p>
<p> The 51-percent [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned company|0.2]] notified the [[Norwegian Water Resources and
    Energy Directorate|Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate|0.4]] of plans to build the plant, to be called
    HydroKraft, pending approval by government agencies. </p>
<p> The company said if it receives the proper approvals in 1999, construction of the plant would be completed during
    2002 and production startup would occur in early 2003. </p>
<p> Earlier this year, the company announced a new technology that would allow it to use clean-burning hydrogen to
    generate electricity. The hydrogen for the plant would be extracted from [[natural gas]]. </p>
<p> Norsk Hydro, a major [[petroleum]] producer, now says studies have shown the proposal to be economically viable. It
    also said the plant's [[carbon dioxide]] emissions would be 90 percent lower than plants using natural gas. </p>
<p> [[Norway]] is the world's second-largest oil exporter, and also produces vast amounts of natural gas from its
    offshore fields. Virtually all of the country's electricity now comes from [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric
    plants]]. </p>
<p> Under the company's plans, natural gas, air and water would be mixed to produce hydrogen, [[nitrogen]] and carbon
    dioxide. </p>
<p> Norsk Hydro wants to build the plant at Karmoey, an island about 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of [[Oslo]]. </p>
