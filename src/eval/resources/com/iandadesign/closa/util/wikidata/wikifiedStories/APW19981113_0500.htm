<p> The new [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Airport|airport|0.2]], a powerful symbol of fledgling independence, is
    ready to open, the head of the Palestinian [[Civil aviation|Civil Aviation|0.2]] Authority said Friday after an
    operations drill with [[Israel|Israeli]] officials. </p>
<p> [[Yasser Arafat International Airport]] in the southern [[Gaza Strip]] was to have opened last week as part of the
    [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement|0.2]]. However, Israel fell behind schedule when
    it held up Cabinet ratification of the accord by two weeks. </p>
<p> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the airport would start operating next week, but has not set a date. </p>
<p> On Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian officials staged a four-hour drill, said Fayez Zeidan, head of the Palestinian
    [[Civil Aviation Authority|Civil Aviation Authority|0.2]]. </p>
<p> About 100 Palestinian airport employees and 50 [[Israelis]] who will share [[Airport security|security|0.2]] duties
    played the roles of passengers and airport personnel. For lack of a plane, the ``passengers'' arrived by
    [[Bus|bus|0.2]]. </p>
<p> Zeidan said the exercise covered arrival and departure procedures, including passport checks as well as customs and
    luggage inspection. </p>
<p> He said the airport was ready for operation. ``We just need to hear from the Israelis,'' Zeidan said. sa-kl </p>
