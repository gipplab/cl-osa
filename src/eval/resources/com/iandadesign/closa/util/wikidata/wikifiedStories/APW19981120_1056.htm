<body><h1 id="header">Prosecutor: Botha may still stand trial</h1>
<p> A [[prosecutor]] on Friday left open the possibility that former apartheid President [[Pieter Willem Botha|P.W.
    Botha]] would be put on trial for abuses committed during [[Dominant minority|white rule|0.2]]. </p>
<p> Prosecutor Jan D'Oliveira said he currently has insufficient evidence to prosecute Botha, but that information
    collected by the [[Truth and reconciliation commission|Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|0.8]],
    which investigated apartheid-era abuses, still must be evaluated to ascertain whether charges would ultimately be
    brought. </p>
<p> Last month, the Truth Comission issued a landmark report on its findings. It said Botha had ordered the 1987 bombing
    of the [[African National Congress|African National Congress|0.8]]' London headquarters and the 1988 bombing of a
    [[Johannesburg]] building housing an anti-apartheid group. </p>
<p> When Botha was head of state in the 1980s, thousands of people were detained without trial. Many were tortured and
    others killed. </p>
<p> The commission can grant [[amnesty]] to those who fully confess to politically motivated abuses committed during
    apartheid. Botha has said he has nothing to confess and has not sought amnesty. </p>
<p> Earlier this year, Botha was convicted of [[contempt of court]] for refusing to testify before the commission. He
    was handed a suspended one-year jail sentence and a 10,000 [[South African rand|rand|0.8]] (dlrs 5,700) fine. He has
    appealed the decision. </p>
