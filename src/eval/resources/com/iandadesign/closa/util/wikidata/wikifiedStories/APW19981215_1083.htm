<body><h1 id="header">German zoo hopes court will allow it to accept baby elephants</h1>
<p> The [[Dresden]] [[Zoo|Zoo|0.2]] went to court Tuesday to challenge [[Jürgen Trittin|Environment Minister Juergen
    Trittin's|1.0]] order forbidding the import of four baby [[Elephant|elephants|0.8]] taken from the wild in
    [[Africa|Africa|0.4]] and abused. </p>
<p> Zoo director Hubert Luecker said the complaint was filed with an administrative court in [[Cologne]]. </p>
<p> The elephants, which were to be sent this month to the Dresden and [[Erfurt|Erfurt|1.0]] zoos in eastern
    [[Germany|Germany|0.8]], were part of a group of 30 young elephants captured in August from herds in [[Botswana]]
    and taken to a [[South Africa|South African]] farm. </p>
<p> A South African judge ruled early this month that the animals had been abused and deprived of water at the farm. He
    granted temporary custody to the [[Humane Society|National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
    Animals|0.2]]. </p>
<p> But while the judge approved the export of four baby elephants to Germany and three to [[Switzerland]], Trittin last
    week said Germany would protest the abuse of animals by not accepting them in its zoos. </p>
<p> Others argue the elephants may face a worse fate if they don't come to Germany. </p>
<p> Norbert Otto, a federal lawmaker from Erfurt, demanded in [[Bundestag|parliament|0.2]] Tuesday that Trittin take
    steps to prevent the animals from being [[Animal euthanasia|put to sleep|0.2]] in South Africa. </p>
<p> In addition, the cultural minister of [[Saxony|Saxony|1.0]], of which Dresden is the capital, asked the state's
    740,000 school children to write letters of protest urging Tritten to allow the elephants into Germany.
