<p> WASHINGTON (AP) -- A [[Cyclone|cyclone|0.8]] four times the size of [[Texas|Texas|0.4]] raged across the northern
    polar region of the planet [[Mars]] last month, according to [[Space observatory|space telescope]] views of the red
    planet. </p>
<p></p>
<p> The [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] announced today that the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] on April 27 spotted an
    immense [[Martian|Martian|0.2]] storm cloud, made up of water [[Ice|ice|0.2]], that was 1,100 miles long and 900
    wide. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Bands of clouds spiraled in a counterclockwise motion around a 200-mile wide eye in the center of the storm, taking
    on a shape that resembled [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes|0.4]] on [[Earth]], astronomers said. </p>
<p></p>
<p> The storm occurred during the summer in Mars' northern hemisphere. It came after seasonal warming
    [[Evaporation|evaporated|0.2]] the [[Carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide|0.8]] [[ice sheet]] that caps the [[Planum
    Boreum|Martian north pole|0.2]] during part of the year. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Officials said the storm was three times larger than a storm spotted 20 years ago by the [[Viking program|Viking
    Orbiter]] spacecraft. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Astronomers used a [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera|wide field planetary camera|0.4]] on Hubble to photograph Mars
    during the planet's closest approach to Earth in nearly eight years. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Two pictures, taken six hours apart on April 27, showed that the storm moved slightly eastward. In the second
    picture, the storm appeared to be in the process of breaking up. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Later pictures by the Hubble camera failed to find the storm, and astronomers said it could have been a short-lived
    [[Phenomenon|phenomenon|0.2]]. </p></body>
