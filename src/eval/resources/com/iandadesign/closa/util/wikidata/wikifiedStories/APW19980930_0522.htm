<p> [[Iraq]]'s trade minister arrived Wednesday to attend an international trade fair and hold discussions with his
    [[Iran|Iranian]] counterpart, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. </p>
<p> Mohammed Mehdi Saleh and his seven-member [[Delegation|delegation|0.2]] traveled by land and crossed into Iran at
    the Khosrawi border point in the western [[Kermanshah province]], the official news agency said. </p>
<p> It quoted Saleh as saying that he would discuss with Iran's Trade Minister [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari|Mohammad
    Shariat-Madari|0.2]] ways of expanding [[Commerce|commercial|0.2]] ties between the two countries. The fair is
    scheduled from Oct. 1 to 11. </p>
<p> This is the second consecutive year that Iraq is attending the [[Tehran]] International Trade Fair, and points at
    the need for the two neighbors to do business despite their traditional animosity. </p>
<p> Iran and Iraq fought an [[Iran-Iraq War|eight-year war]] which ended with a [[United Nations|U.N.|0.6]]-brokered
    cease-fire. </p>
<p> Iran claims Iraq still holds 4,000 [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] while Iraq says Iran is holding about 20,000
    prisoners. More than 1 million people were killed or wounded on both sides during the 1980-88 war. </p>
<p> Tehran accuses [[Baghdad]] of helping Iranian opposition groups and the two sides accuse each other of allowing
    infiltrators to sneak across their borders for [[Sabotage|acts of sabotage|0.4]]. </p>
<p> In December, Iraqi Vice President [[Taha Yassin Ramadan]] became the highest-ranking Iraqi to visit Tehran since the
    [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]] when he attended the [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]] meeting. ti/vj </p>
