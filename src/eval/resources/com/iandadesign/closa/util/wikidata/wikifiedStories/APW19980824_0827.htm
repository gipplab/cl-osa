<body><h1 id="header">Israel increases [[Security|security|0.2]] at airports following threats</h1>
<p> [[Israel]] is adding security personnel at its [[International airport|international airport|0.2]] in response to
    threats by [[Islamist terrorism|Islamic militants|0.6]] to attack Israeli and [[United States|U.S.|0.2]] targets,
    including airlines, officials said Monday. </p>
<p> Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s senior adviser, [[David Bar-Illan|David Bar-Illan|0.8]], said Israel would
    use all measures it deemed necessary to fight [[Terrorism|terrorism|0.6]]. </p>
<p> Asked whether this included [[Preemptive war|pre-emptive strikes|0.2]], Bar-Illan told The Associated Press: ``I
    don't want to be specific about anything but obviously we are not ruling out anything.'' </p>
<p> Threats against U.S. and Israeli targets emerged after last week's U.S. [[Airstrike|air strikes|0.4]] in [[Sudan]]
    and [[Afghanistan]] that were aimed at [[Osama bin Laden]], a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi|0.2]] millionaire and Islamic
    militant linked to the bombings of two U.S. [[Diplomatic mission|embassies|0.2]] in [[East Africa|East Africa|0.6]]
    this month. </p>
<p> On Sunday, a leading [[Muslim|Muslim|0.8]] [[Activism|activist|0.2]] close to bin Laden said Islamic militants are
    preparing to retaliate for the air strikes by targeting U.S. and Israeli [[Strategy|strategic|0.2]] sites and
    airliners. </p>
<p> A U.S. basketball team from the [[University of Connecticut]], which arrived Monday for a nine-day tour of friendly
    games, hired two private [[Security guard|security guards|0.2]] to accompany them in Israel. </p>
<p> ``The [[Academic administration|administration|0.2]] of the University of Connecticut demanded bodyguards and we
    readily agreed,'' said the teams' [[Tour operator|tour operator|0.2]] Nels Hawkinson. ``Had it not been for the
    bombings in Afghanistan and Sudan we would not have seen the need,'' he said. </p>
