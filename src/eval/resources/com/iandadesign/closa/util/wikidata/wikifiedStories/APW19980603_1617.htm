<p> PORT DICKSON, Tues. - [[Federal Government|Federal|0.2]] and [[State|State|0.2]] [[Government agency|Government
    agencies|0.2]], given the task to undertake [[Economy|economic|0.2]] projects under the Development Programme for
    the Hardcore Poor (PPRT), must ensure their successful [[Implementation|implementation|0.2]]. </p>
<p> [[Rural|Rural|0.2]] Development Minister Datuk Annuar Musa said yesterday those responsible should closely monitor
    the implementation of the projects and ensure that the [[Resource allocation|allocation|0.2]] provided by the
    [[Ministry (government department)|ministry|0.2]] benefit the hardcore [[Poverty|poor|0.2]] participants. </p>
<p> He said those responsible, including district officers, must personally check on the progress of the projects being
    carried out. </p>
<p> ``We don't want to see projects as being a success on paper but on inspection, they don't show the desired
    results,'' he added. </p>
<p> According to him, it was the ministry's policy now that the [[Minister (government)|minister|0.2]], deputy minister,
    parliamentary secretary, director-general and other senior ministry officials had to visit the PPRT projects to see
    what was happening to the allocation given by the Government. </p>
<p> Annuar said this after visiting a [[Mussel|mussel|0.4]] rearing project in Kuala [[Lukut]] today as part of his
    day-long visit to several PPRT projects in [[Negeri Sembilan|Negri Sembilan]]. </p>
<p> Present were Chembong Assemblyman Firdaus Harun and [[Port Dickson]] district officer Hassan Nawawi Abdul
    Rahman. </p>
<p> Annuar added that the implementing agencies should also conduct in-depth [[Research|studies|0.2]] of the projects
    proposed to ensure their viability. </p></body>
