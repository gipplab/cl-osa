<p> [[Austria]]'s president told [[Secretary of State|Secretary of State|0.2]] [[Madeleine Albright]] on Thursday that
    the government was establishing a commission to identify art which was stolen from [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]
    victims by the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. </p>
<p> Austrian officials said President [[Thomas Klestil]] told Albright, who paid a one-day visit to Vienna after the
    [[Moscow]] summit, that the commission would first determine the origin of all art works owned by the Federal Museum
    here. </p>
<p> There was no statement on the art issue by U.S. officials. Albright left for the [[United States|United States|0.2]]
    after meetings with Klestil, Chancellor [[Viktor Klima]] and Foreign Minister [[Wolfgang Schüssel|Wolfgang
    Schuessel|0.4]]. </p>
<p> Austria, the United States and 37 other nations have launched a drive to identify billions of dollars worth of art
    stolen from Holocaust victims throughout Europe. </p>
<p> The [[World Jewish Congress]] estimates the current value of stolen art at between dlrs 90 billion and dlrs 140
    billion. </p>
<p> In June, the [[Association of Art Museum Directors]] in the United States recommended that American art museums
    check their own collections to determine if any works were stolen during the war and set up a worldwide database for
    tracking. </p>
<p> Austria was absorbed into [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Germany]] in 1938 and was restored as an independent nation following
    World War II. </p>
