<p> President [[Saddam Hussein]] said Saturday the [[United States|United States|0.6]] will reap nothing but a ``harvest
    ... full of thorns'' from its campaign against [[Iraq]]. </p>
<p> Addressing the nation on television to mark the anniversary of the end of the 1980-88 [[Iran-Iraq war]], Saddam also
    urged Iran to normalize relations with Iraq. </p>
<p> Saddam did not refer to his decision Wednesday to freeze cooperation with [[United Nations|U.N.]] arms inspectors,
    but he said the United States and its [[Allies|allies|0.2]] would be misled if they thought they could bring Iraq to
    its knees. </p>
<p> This is exactly what the [[Politics of Iran|Iranian government|0.8]] under the late [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah
    Ruhollah Khomeini]] thought it could do in the war, but it failed, Saddam said. </p>
<p> ``Those imposing aggression on Iraq ... and the unfair [[Embargo|embargo|0.8]] neglect this fact today,'' Saddam
    said, referring to sweeping [[Sanction|sanctions|0.2]] the United Nations imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
    [[Kuwait]]. </p>
<p> ``They are making the same mistake. Their harvest will be full of thorns and the outcome will be a taste of
    bitterness.'' </p>
<p> The president delivered his speech in a black suit. He had decreed that Saturday be celebrated as a day of victory
    over Iran, and an [[Artillery|artillery|0.2]] salute of 101 guns boomed over [[Baghdad]] in the early morning.
    National radio and television played [[Patriotism|patriotic|0.2]] songs for the occasion. </p>
<p> Saddam spoke, 7th graf pvs </p></body>
