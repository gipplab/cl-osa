Ellis appeared regularly throughout the series of True Blood after first appearing as the cook at a local restaurant in 2008. He played the role of Lafayette, a charismatic gay medium who was able to contact ghosts.
He also featured alongside Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer in the film adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's novel The Help in 2011.
Spencer paid tribute to Ellis on Saturday with a comment posted on Twitter: "Just got word that we lost @nelsanellisofficial. My heart breaks for his kids and family."

McMillan said on Twitter that he was "stunned" and "devastated" by the news.
Ellis is survived by his grandmother Alex Brown, his father Tommie Lee Thompson and his son Breon, along with seven siblings.
