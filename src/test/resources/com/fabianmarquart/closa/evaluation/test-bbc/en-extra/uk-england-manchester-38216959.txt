Rochdale woman, 102, has life-saving cancer surgery

A great-grandmother has had life-saving cancer surgery - at the age of 102, and without a general anaesthetic.
Adelaide Kershaw, of Littleborough near Rochdale, had a lump the size of a tangerine removed from her forehead.
She is the oldest patient to have had surgery at The Christie, the specialist cancer hospital in Manchester said.
After the operation to treat her rare form of skin cancer, Ms Kershaw said she was "well", adding: "I just want to get walking again."
Her consultant at the hospital, Damir Kosutic, said the tumour was causing her great difficulties but she "came through the surgery really well and was very brave".
"Not every patient would be able to have that sort of extensive surgery while awake," he added.
One of Ms Kershaw's two daughters, Christine Garvey, said her mother - who has four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren - was "keen to get back to her crocheting".
