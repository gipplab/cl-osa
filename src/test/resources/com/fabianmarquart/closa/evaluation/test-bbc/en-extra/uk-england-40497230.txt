Billy Monger crash: Amputee teen racer back behind wheel

A teenage racing driver who had to have both legs amputated after a high speed crash has got back behind the wheel.
Billy Monger, from Surrey, hit the back of a stationary car at Donington Park in April and lost both of his lower legs, days before he turned 18.
Eleven weeks on, he has now returned to the cockpit of a racing car at Brands Hatch in Kent.
The adapted Fun Cup endurance racer is designed to look like a VW Beetle and has steering wheel mounted controls.
The Formula 4 racer returned to the track with the assistance of Team BRIT, which helps disabled drivers and injured servicemen to compete in motorsport.
He said: "It's been really good just to get back behind the wheel.
And he added: "Team BRIT have got two steering wheels for me to try out today.
"I've decided which one I prefer, now it's just about perfecting the technique."
Dave Player, Team BRIT founder said the aim was to give the teenager his first time out on the track and to get his race licence back.
Monger said his ambition now was to compete in the Le Mans 24 Hours with Frenchman Frederic Sausset, who lost both arms and legs through an illness.
"I'm not 100% committed to anything yet, we're just looking at different options to see what's best for me in the future," he said.
"There's a lot of work involved in what's going on with my own rehabilitation, but that's all going well, so hopefully we'll be back out on track soon."
The teenager thanked fans who had overwhelmed him with help: "People keep saying I'm the inspiration but I think all these people coming together to support someone who has gone through an accident like this, they're the true inspiration."
